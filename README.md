Huh?
====

So, you see... I dropkicked MacVim to the preveribal curb. I'm now one
of the [hip](http://www.sojones.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/hip-kid-in-headband-300x207.jpg) kids using [vicoapp](http://www.vicoapp.com/). It's the bees knees, peoples.
  
This is why you should immediately stop what you're doing, fork the
shit out of this repo, and start using vico.
  
You can haz that shit here: http://www.vicoapp.com/
  
Like vim, you can script it. Scripting is done with
[nu](http://programming.nu/about)
  
I've put some stuff in my site.nu file in this repo. If you get [vicoapp](http://www.vicoapp.com/) you
should put your site.nu into ~/Library/Application Support/Vico/
  
That is all folks.
  
But pthrash, you're not very funny...

Yes, I know... even still, you should totally follow the shit out of me
on twitter... cuz I'm all narcissistic 'n shtuff.
