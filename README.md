Huh?
====

So, you see... I dropkicked MacVim to the proveribal curb. I'm now one
of the [hip][L2] kids using [vico][L1]. It's the bees knees, peoples.
  
This is why you should immediately stop what you're doing, fork the
shit out of this repo, and start using [vico][L1]
  
You can haz that shit here: [http://www.vicoapp.com/][L1]
  
Like vim, you can script it. Scripting is done with
[nu][L4]
  
I've put some stuff in my site.nu file in this repo. If you get [vico][L1] you
should put your site.nu into ~/Library/Application Support/Vico/
  
That is all folks.
  
But pthrash, you're not very funny...
-------------------------------------

Yes, I know... even still, you should totally follow the shit out of me
on twitter... cuz I'm all narcissistic 'n shtuff.
